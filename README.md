# roleplay-bot
If you want to play as multiple characters in a single text-based roleplay story in a Discord server, this is your bot. So in your server, you'd have one channel where you can type the messages. You'd have multiple other channels where the bot can send those messages on your behalf, so that it looks like another character is making those posts, not you.

How to get the bot running-
* Go to Discord Developers' portal and create a bot.
* Invite the bot to your server.
* Link this code to that bot by copying your bot token over and pasting in the code.
* Enable developer mode. Then copy the IDs of the channels you want the bot to work with and paste them into the code appropriately.
* Run the code and have fun!

How to use this bot-
* In your source channel, type {max} {rp} blablablablablabla to make max_bot send blablablablablabla to the roleplay channel.
* In your source channel, type {max} {chat} blablablablablabla to make max_bot send blablablablablabla to the chat channel.
* You can add or alter channels or commands however you want. If you want more channels, just add more `elif` blocks. If you want to alter the commands, you can do that too.
